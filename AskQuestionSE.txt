I have been using Kivy for over a year now. But haven't done anything with it lately. I went back to play with it and to my surprise, and something wierd happend. Kivy seemed to be running, the app window would open, but nothing was beeing displayed. So I tried with some apps that were previously working (inaltered) and and the same thing occurred. When I try to run the app, instead of the working app, this is what I get:

meanwhile, this is what is going to the log:

So no error messages of any kind. Can anyone shed some light on the matter?

I am running on a ubuntu 14.04 machine, same one the apps were written on.

Edit 1:
As requested, this is the code I tried running today, the other app is several files worth of code:

    from kivy.app import App
    from kivy.uix.button import Button
    from kivy.uix.screenmanager import Screen, ScreenManager

    class MyApp(App):

        def build(self):
            screen = Screen()
            screen.add_widget(Button(text='this is a button'))
            sm = ScreenManager()
            sm.add_widget(screen)
            return sm


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        MyApp().run()

I am scheptical this will help at all, since I also tried running the hello world example at [KivyBasics](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/basic.html)

Edit 2:
So I went back to my older machine and ran the codes. Everything is working fine. Same setup.
Did a clean install of Ubuntu and Kivy (installed 3.16.0-73-generic #95~14.04.1-Ubuntu for touchscreen support). Problem persists. I have read somewhere graphic drivers may be at fault. But I see no option for driver update or alternative.
